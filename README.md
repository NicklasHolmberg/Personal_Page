# Welcome to Nicklas Holmberg's Corner! ‚òïüë®‚Äçüíª

Hello there! I'm Nicklas, an applied math enthusiast with an interest for computational models in machine learning, specifically focusing on  Complex-Valued Neural Networks (CVNNs). When I'm not tinkering with my computer on a side project or working as a software engineer at ChromaCode, Inc., you can find me brewing the perfect espresso shot, adding a dash of fun to the office atmosphere with my coffee-making rituals.

## A Little More About Me

- **Education:** Graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics - Computer Science from the University of California - San Diego.
- **Skills:** Toolbox includes significant experience in MATLAB, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and cloud systems like AWS. Thrives on turning data into insights and algorithms into actionable solutions.

## Some of My Recent Projects

- **CVNNs:** Explored the efficacy of various complex-valued activation functions in CVNNs, aiming to enhance data analysis in complex-valued data sets, including signal processing & bioinformatics. Check out my findings and experiments on [my GitHub](https://github.com/NicklasHolmberg/ComplexValuedNeuralNetworks).
- **Financial Modeling:** Developed a serverless AWS-based workflow for real-time stock price monitoring, demonstrating the power of cloud technology in financial analysis.

## Beyond the Code

- **Running:** Balances equations and life with running‚Äî for both the soul and the body. It's a way of staying grounded and energized.
- **Travel & Curiosity:** My passport is a collection of curios endeavors, each destination a new chapter in my quest for learning and exploration.

## The Future

- **Grad School Plans:** Gearing up for grad school, aiming to delve deeper into CVNNs, computational models, and NLP. The goal? To bridge the gap between theoretical math and practical machine learning applications.
